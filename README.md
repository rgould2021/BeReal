## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Getting the layout to work how I wanted to was a big issue, I had trouble trying to find out how to style everything how it needed to be styled. Making sure the segues go to the right
spots and that when you click on certain buttons it brings you to the right view controller. It was hard to link everythink to work as intended.
